# Multitenancy Testing Plan

## ✅ Implementation Status
- [x] Schema updates (organizationId in all models)
- [x] Auth middleware (includes organizationId in JWT)
- [x] Organization middleware (attaches req.organizationId)
- [x] All controllers updated with organizationId filters
- [x] Routes updated with organizationMiddleware
- [x] Schemas updated for new fields
- [x] Code compiles successfully
- [x] Server starts without errors

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Unit Tests (Code Logic)
- [ ] Create test utilities for organization setup
- [ ] Test middleware functions
- [ ] Test controller logic with mock data

### Phase 2: Integration Tests (API Endpoints)
- [ ] Test authentication with organization context
- [ ] Test data isolation between organizations
- [ ] Test cross-organization access prevention

### Phase 3: End-to-End Tests (Full Workflow)
- [ ] Create multiple test organizations
- [ ] Test complete user journeys per organization
- [ ] Verify admin/representative role isolation

## 📋 Test Cases Needed

### Authentication & Authorization
1. JWT includes organizationId
2. organizationMiddleware attaches req.organizationId
3. Users cannot access data from other organizations
4. Admin operations scoped to user's organization

### Data Isolation
1. Pings/Waves/Comments filtered by organizationId
2. Surges scoped to organization
3. Announcements targeted by categories within organization
4. Public endpoints respect organization filtering

### API Endpoints
1. Create operations include organizationId
2. Update operations verify organization ownership
3. Delete operations scoped to organization
4. List operations filtered by organization

## 🛠️ Test Setup Requirements

### Database Setup
- [ ] Create test organizations
- [ ] Create test users for each organization
- [ ] Seed test data (pings, waves, comments, etc.)
- [ ] Set up admin/representative users

### Test Tools
- [ ] API testing tool (Postman/Insomnia)
- [ ] Database inspection tools
- [ ] Authentication helpers

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Create Test Organizations**: Set up 2-3 test organizations in database
2. **Seed Test Data**: Create users, pings, waves for each org
3. **API Testing**: Use tools like Postman to test endpoints
4. **Cross-Org Verification**: Ensure data isolation works
5. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error handling

## 📊 Success Criteria

- ✅ All API endpoints respect organization boundaries
- ✅ Users can only see/modify their organization's data
- ✅ Admin functions scoped to organization
- ✅ Public endpoints work with organization filtering
- ✅ No data leakage between organizations
- ✅ Performance remains acceptable with org filters
